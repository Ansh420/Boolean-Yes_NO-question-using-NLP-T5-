BoolQ is a question answering dataset for yes/no questions containing 15942 examples. 
These questions are naturally occurring ---they are generated in unprompted and unconstrained settings.

Each example is a triplet of (question, passage, answer), with the title of the page as optional additional context. 
The text-pair classification setup is similar to existing natural language inference tasks.

By sampling questions from a distribution of information-seeking queries (rather than prompting annotators for text pairs), we observe significantly more challenging examples compared to existing NLI datasets.
